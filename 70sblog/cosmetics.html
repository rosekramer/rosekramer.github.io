<body><p>These advertisements highlight the way Women were presented to the world in the 1970s. At the time second-wave feminism was blooming and it's interesting to look at ads like these in order to see the capitalist idea of a Woman. Each ad obviously has a level of fantasy to it, but they still represent an idea of how a woman was or was idealized in the seventies.
<br><br>
From a graphic design perspective, the idea of clean design was still very much present then, but the visuals were equally as strong and full of color. I love how big and prevalent the type is as it's really fun and leaves almost no space for anything but the tagline.
<br><br>
This ad for Maybelline below appeals to me mostly because of the product itself. The idea that they were able to fit so many products in one compact container is cool and innovative to me. Also in the tagline for the product it talks about this idea of a girl that travels and goes places. This concept which seems simple to us now, is so engrained in the design of the product and represents something much bigger. This represents the introduction of a time where it was majorly acceptable for a woman to be working and going places other than the home.
<br><br>
This ad for Baby soft body care items on the right has beautiful big bold type against a opaquely white image. The tagline is the part that is concerning or interesting to me. This idea of a sexy baby is strange and fetishized in this ad. Also, like most pink products or products marketed to young girls they automatically associate innocence with sexual purity. This idea is problematic and it's interesting that this ad is being displayed at around the same time the Roe v. Wade case (the Supreme Court case that legalized abortion in America) was being won. It shows just how unconnected ads are from the real world. The fantasy in this ad is displaying sexual preservation while the reality of the world is fighting for sexual freedom.
<br><br>
This Maybelline ad on the left also takes advantage of this giant type trend. I find this ad particularly interesting because it shows the anti-fashion/makeup trend that was happening during the 70s styled along with the almost overdone eyes that people normally associate with the 70s or the disco movement.
<br><br>
Lastly I particularly love this ad for PSSSSSST Dry Shampoo mostly for the design of it. I find it interesting how the ad is less commercial or product based but more about the use of the product. The type places emphases on how quick and easy it is to use rather than it being obsessed with product placement like most ads are in nowadays.</p>
