	You can’t speak about the evolution of modern-day red carpet style without mentioning Diana Ross. The Detroit-bred pop supernova singularly transformed the fashion landscape with her affinity for luxury and unadulterated glamour. Before she became a legendary powerhouse on the music front, Diana had an unbridled love for fashion and beauty. She studied modeling and cosmetology as a child, and even had dreams of becoming a fashion designer (those dreams came to fruition when she later helped design costumes for “Mahogany”). When a chance meeting with Berry Gordy launched her on a trajectory toward music superstardom, Diana kept her fondness for fashion near, choosing decadent costumes littered with sequins and sparkling embellishment.
	<br><br>
	As the lead singer of the Supremes, she sang hits like “You Can’t Hurry Love” and “Where Did Our Love Go?” in dazzling gowns with sultry slits and polished shoulder-length bobs. Later, as her solo career skyrocketed, Diana donned glittering jumpsuits and sultry plunging sequin gowns to perform hits like “I’m Coming Out” and “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”
	<br> <br>
	In the beauty realm, her hair and eye makeup was always dramatic and bold. You’d be hard-pressed to find Diana without a full set of top and bottom lashes and a full afro billowing in the wind. Ms. Ross was unapologetically decadent and over-the-top, and that made her a visionary. She wore her confidence on her sleeve, with a show-stopping approach to beauty and style that made her the standout fashion icon of her day, and launched a style legacy that continues to thrive some 40 years later.
