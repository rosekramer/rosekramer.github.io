<h1>Bianca Jagger</h1>

	<p> Born in Nicaragua as Bianca Perez-Mora Macias, Bianca Jagger is known for being both the first wife of Mick Jagger and one of the most impeccably stylish women in the world. Bianca's exotic beauty caught the Rolling Stones' frontman's eye at a party in France after one of their concerts in 1970 and they married a year later in St Tropez. Bianca has since said that her marriage was over as soon as it began, but black and white photographs of the cooler-than-cool pair dripping with '70s glamour suggest it was beautiful while it lasted. Their split did little to snuff out Bianca's jet-setting, party-going reputation, and she was a solid fixture on Manhattan's Studio 54 scene always decked out in luxurious furs, glittering sequins and exquisitely tailored white YSL trouser suits.

A close friend and photographic favorite of Andy Warhol (her daughter Jade once urinated on a piece of his artwork), Bianca also personified the elegant Halston woman along with Liza Minnelli and Lauren Bacall. It was Halston she wore to her 30th birthday party at Studio 54 where she famously entered atop a white horse lead by a semi-clad man, and it was probably Halston she had to thank for a hat collection that would put Lady Gaga's to shame.
