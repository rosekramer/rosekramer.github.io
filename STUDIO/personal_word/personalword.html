Should be <mark>PERSONAL.</mark> After doing a little research into personal design or design solely for the viewer <br> 
I came across the concept which Eli Pariser calls "filter bubbles." Here is the great TedTalk he did <br> which explains the concept perfectly.

This concept of over-personalized data made me question how we design instead for human <br> connection and empathy instead of for algorithmic personalization. I realized that empathy played <br> a big part in the content making process of personal design. Gaining empathy with the viewer is <br>might be one of the most important parts of designing on the internet. Even though this empathy <br>is between the computer and the user, it is building empathy within the user nonetheless. 
<br>
<br>
When thinking of design that encourages empathic content I immediately thought of a few <br>new features Facebook recently added. The first addition I thought about was the Facebook <br>Feeling/Activity tab. This tab allows you to let others know what you are feeling in that moment <br>without making a status. The other example is Facebook's personalized timed messages. Every so <br>often a message pops up on Facebook that reads Good Evening, Rose or Good Morning, Rose. This <br>little message makes one feel more connected to the technology they're using. The last feature on <br>Facebook that I want to touch on is the new like button options. Previously there was only the option <br>to like another users post. A like is an unemotional blanket wasy to connect with another user. With the <br>addition of the Love, Haha, Wow, Sad and Angry like buttons it allows the user to interact on a deeper level <br>emotionally with the user. 
<br>
<br>
I also thought about the idea of Conversational User Interface (CUI), like Siri, Alexa etc. Attaching a voice <br>to an inanimate piece of technology makes it seem like there is another being there to connect with. The <br>first example of this was with the unveiling of the Macintosh computer in 1984. In this video below you can <br>watch how by making the computer have a voice or display type it connects with the emotions of the human <br>audience.
