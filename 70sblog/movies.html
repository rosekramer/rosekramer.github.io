This first movie title sequence is from the movie Foxy Brown which was released in 1974. The action film starred black actress Pam Grier and is considered a controversial film as it contributed to stereotypes about black women. Although the film is considered to be derogatory of black women it still contributed to the ever-moving women's movement of the 1970s, by providing strong and brave woman role models. The titles embrace everything from rotoscoping to multi-layered animation. The sequence tries to make an icon out of Grier highlighting her afro and almond shaped eyes. The vivid, neon colors enhance the music and overall visual story of the titles.

The next title sequence is from Saturday Night Fever, the movie released in 1977 shows the life of Tony Manero (John Travolta) as a dancer at a Brooklyn disco. The titles for this movie are in constant movement, as you are following Tony around his neighborhood. The cinematography matches the movement of New York City and disco dancing which allows you to be automatically immersed in the neighborhood and plot. The type follows this same idea of movement and is almost lit up like neon signs at nighttime or something you'd see in a disco club.

The last movie title sequence is a little bit different in tone and style as it's a James Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever. Everyone knows how amazing James Bond title sequences are and this one definitely follows the same methodology. The film released in 1971 is about diamond smuggling. The titles for this movie are amazing in my opinion as they are working with a collage/cut out look that seamlessly blends each transition. The diamonds against a dark background are sexy, mysterious, and beautiful everything a Bond film is.
