<p>Fashion and feminism has always been a tricky subject to tackle, some believe that the issue has no place in our capitalist world, others think it's important that your outer being represents your inner feelings. Recently there has been an uptick in "feminist" clothing. Christian Dior's new creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri, made all of her models walk out in shirts that read, "We Should All Be Feminists." These shirts allowed the hashtag #weshouldallbefeminists to blow up on social media, and later celebrities like Kendall Jenner and Rihanna along with hoards of fashion bloggers were seen wearing these shirts. The shirt although has good intent, (the phrase is from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Ted talk) can confuse one as the industry that it is being made out of is the same one that is regulating Women's bodies. This brings me into the main topic of this post which is the movement towards "anti-fashion" of the 1970s. 
<br><br>
Housewife culture of the 1950s and 60s was to be overturned in the 1970s and so the emergence of new styles for the working woman came about in the 1970s. Designers like Halston and Yves Saint Laurent, designed pieces inspired by menswear silhouettes, and bell bottom pants became the signature of the decade. All while the anti-fashion movement came about, an article in Ms. Magazine, talking about then Vogue Fashion Editor, Diana Vreeland, reinforced this idea of anti-fashion. The idea of anti-fashion is that fashion is the "easiest" or "simplest" route for women/girls to take and that all it does is confine a woman to thinking that beauty is her main prerogative.<h1>Who really cares what you look like when there are bigger issues at hand?</h1> At the root of it the idea is that who really cares what you look like when there are bigger issues at hand. In the 1970s feminists believed that embellishment of any type was considered oppressive.  The idea of "natural" and "anti-beauty" were seen to be the only ideal of beauty, when in my opinion that is opposite of the feminist goal. Celebrities like Farrah Fawcett and Bianca Jagger became icons of the 1970s as they embraced this look of natural beauty which was accessible for every woman. </p>
