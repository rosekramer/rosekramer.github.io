	<div class="coshover">                 
       <p>These advertisements highlight the way Women were presented to the world in the 1970s. At the time second-wave feminism was blooming and it's interesting to look at ads like these in order to see the capitalist idea of a Woman.</p>

	<div class="maghover">
		<p>Ms. Magazine launched in 1971 by Gloria Steinem proclaimed the reality of being a woman, not the fantasied one. In it's pages, articles about illegal abortions, studies on date rape and domestic violence were highlighted for the first time in a national magazine.  </p>

       <p>Foxy Brown, Saturday Night Fever, Diamonds Are Forever, all movies from the 1970s with beautiful imagery, typography and themes. </p>

	<p>At the root of it, graphic design is used to persuade people with a written or visual message. Inherently there is something "political" about every piece of graphic design whether it is subconscious or not. The Vietnam war was very much still in affect halfway into the 1970s and the Kent State shootings caused need for protest.</p>

	<div class="racehover">
	<p>Starting in New York and Philadelphia during the late 60s the Disco movement combined  funk, soul, pop, and salsa as a reprisal against rock music. Most music movements before Disco had white people at the forefront. The Disco movement of the 1970s was inclusionary to all races and genders and it's forerunners were mostly Black.</p>

	<div class="rechover">
	<p>The physicality of the record has been lost in the age of Spotify and Apple Music. The visual of an single or album is still important, but a record is like owning a piece of art, both musically visually, and physically. </p>

	<a href="http://www.rosekramer.com/70sblog/antifashion.html" class="text"><b>Fashion + Feminism</b></a>
	<div class="stylehover">
	<p>The idea of anti-fashion is that fashion is the "easiest" or "simplest" route for women/girls to take and that all it does is confine a woman to thinking that beauty is her main prerogative. At the root of it the idea is that who really cares what you look like when there are bigger issues at hand. </p>

	</a>
	<div class="carhover">
	<p>When I look at a beautiful car, there is an emotional connection that is inexplicable. There is also something so undeniably American seeing these kids riding their cars in the wind. The freedom that they are experiencing is something Americans crave or at least is depicted in advertisements.</p>
