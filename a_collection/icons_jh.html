	Hall was staying at a hostel on the French Riviera when she was discovered sunbathing on a Saint Tropez beach by fashion agent Claude Haddad. She moved to Paris where she shared an apartment with singer Grace Jones (who at that time was also a model) and Jessica Lange (also modeling) and immersed herself in the Parisian nightlife, often performing risqué cabaret acts in clubs and parties with Jones. Soon after, she moved in with fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez and her modelling career began. She appeared, in the guise of a mermaid, on the cover of Roxy Music's album Siren (1975). A few months later, the group's lead singer, Bryan Ferry, gave her an engagement ring. Her relationship with Ferry continued and she also appeared in the promotional film for his solo hit "Let's Stick Together" (1976).<br><br>

By 1977, Hall had been on 40 magazine covers including Italian Vogue and Cosmopolitan. She was earning modelling fees in excess of $1,000 per day. Her long blonde hair and height of six feet quickly made her one of the most visible and photographed models of the day. That year she met Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger, for whom she would eventually leave Bryan Ferry, at a dinner party in Manhattan. Hall and Jagger were often seen together around New York, frequenting high-profile nightspots of the era such as Studio 54 and 21 Club. The Rolling Stones' song "Miss You", released as a single in May 1978, was written by Jagger for Hall. Many years later, Hall was also the subject of the Bryan Ferry song "Kiss and Tell" (1988) following the publishing of her autobiography, Tall Tales (1985), that included details of their relationship. Bianca Jagger began divorce proceedings as a result of her husband's involvement with Hall.

With the large fees Hall was able to command as a top model, she was able to buy herself an 8.1 km2 ranch in Lone Oak, Texas. She continued her modelling career and later moved into acting and television work. She also modeled for artists Francesco Clemente, Ed Ruscha and Lucian Freud.
