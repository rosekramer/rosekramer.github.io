GOOD BONES - MAGGIE SMITH
</h2>
Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
<br>
<br>
Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
<br>
<br>
in a thousand <a href="http://creativepool.com/files/candidate/portfolio/_w250/802552.gif">delicious,</a> ill-advised ways,
<br>
<br>
a <b>thousand</b> deliciously ill-advised ways
<br>
<br>
I’ll keep from my children. The world is at <em>least</em>
<br>
<br>
<a href="http://bestanimations.com/Signs&Shapes/Worship/YingYang/ying-yang-classic-black-white-spinning-animated-gif.gif">fifty percent</a> terrible, and that’s a <em>conservative</em>
<br>
<br>
estimate, though I keep this from my <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ec/c8/bb/ecc8bb1b87251c0f0a21f6e2ac210b8f.gif">children.

For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
<br>
<br>
For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
<br>
<br>
sunk in a <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/JXHhI4o9NCf8k/giphy.gif">lake. </a> <b>Life is short</b> and the world
<br>
<br>
is at <em>least</em> half terrible, and for every kind
<br>
<br>
stranger, there is one who would break you,
<br>
<br>
though I keep this from my <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ec/c8/bb/ecc8bb1b87251c0f0a21f6e2ac210b8f.gif">children. </a> I am trying
<br>
<br>
to sell them the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/d0jolDRzq28F2/giphy.gif">world. </a> Any decent realtor,
<br>
<br>
walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
<br>
<br>
about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
<br>
<br>
right? You could make this place <a href="https://ptmacias.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/1-sparkles-for-blogs.gif"> beautiful.</a>
