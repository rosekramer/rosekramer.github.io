In the opening titles of Richard Linklater's 1993 movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrtQ5uIOcKY">Dazed and Confused,</a>which depicts high school in 1976, students of all ages ride in on their glossy convertibles and trucks to the sound of Aerosmith's Sweet Emotion. <h1>When I look at a beautiful car, there is an emotional connection that is inexplicable</h1>The song Sweet Emotion describes exactly how you, or at least I feel when I look at a beautiful car, there is an emotional connection that is inexplicable. There is also something so undeniably American seeing these kids riding their cars in the wind. The freedom that they are experiencing is something Americans crave or at least is depicted in advertisements. The car allows one to be part of a group but at the same time customization/actual vehicle allows for one to be an individual and go on their own path. These following ads represent ideas of women and travel.  
<br><br>
This first ad is for the Jaguar E-type from 1974. The ad depicts the already sensually/womanly shaped convertible in a field with a woman leaning against the car stroking the car. The tagline reads, "Nobody's Pussycat." Briefly I want to touch on the layout of the ad; this ad is interesting as compared to ads I usually see in magazines today the copy takes up about half the page. This begs to question, who is really going to read all that just to buy a car? Anyway, back to the real issues here. This ad is really selling two things, the Jaguar E-type and the woman. A lot of car ads depict women as objects because the target market is men, showing the enforced gender roles that even cars play in our lives. The tagline is supposed to show the strength of the car, but it really shows how the woman is the "pussycat" compared to the strength of the car, further placing the woman in a role that is quiet, submissive, and weak. At this point the actual car is irrelevant and instead, the fantasy of what the car can get you becomes most important. 
<br><br>
This next ad is for the Ford Econoline from 1976. This ad shows a very popular car at the time, the van. The idea that you could store many things and have many people in your car was innovative and convenient. This ad pulls you into the fantasy of a surfer/west coast lifestyle where life seems easy and everyone is physically attractive. The most interesting thing about this ad is the tagline which reads, "Your great van ideas, and Ford's." This is an idea I brought up in the first paragraph; cars allow us to feel as if we are part of a group but also we can customize them to make them feel unique and individual, something very important to Americans. This car shows the freedom of a car, the idea that you are free to be and go wherever you want in a car.
