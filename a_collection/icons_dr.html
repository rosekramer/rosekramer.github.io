	You can’t speak about the evolution of modern-day red carpet style without mentioning Diana Ross. The Detroit-bred pop supernova singularly transformed the fashion landscape with her affinity for luxury and unadulterated glamour. Before she became a legendary powerhouse on the music front, Diana had an unbridled love for fashion and beauty. She studied modeling and cosmetology as a child, and even had dreams of becoming a fashion designer (those dreams came to fruition when she later helped design costumes for “Mahogany”). When a chance meeting with Berry Gordy launched her on a trajectory toward music superstardom, Diana kept her fondness for fashion near, choosing decadent costumes littered with sequins and sparkling embellishment.

	As the lead singer of the Supremes, she sang hits like “You Can’t Hurry Love” and “Where Did Our Love Go?” in dazzling gowns with sultry slits and polished shoulder-length bobs. Later, as her solo career skyrocketed, Diana donned glittering jumpsuits and sultry plunging sequin gowns to perform hits like “I’m Coming Out” and “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough.”
	<br> <br>
	In the beauty realm, her hair and eye makeup was always dramatic and bold. You’d be hard-pressed to find Diana without a full set of top and bottom lashes and a full afro billowing in the wind. Ms. Ross was unapologetically decadent and over-the-top, and that made her a visionary. She wore her confidence on her sleeve, with a show-stopping approach to beauty and style that made her the standout fashion icon of her day, and launched a style legacy that continues to thrive some 40 years later.
