<h1>The New Discos: Life Begins at Midnight

It's midnight and the night people are out, ready for action. The discothèque scene in Manhattan has not only revived but exploded.
<br> <br>

The new discothèques, multiplying like amoebas, differ from their counterparts of a decade ago in a number of ways. The décor and accouterments are more sophisticated, with such features as totem poles of light intersecting a dance floor, beams of light falling as thickly and irregularly as snowflakes and swirling vapors of fog, achieved with dry ice.
<br> <br>
The fashion scene has also changed. There is no longer a uniform, comparable to the jeans and silk shirts and rows of chains of less than a generation ago. Now it's dressing according to mood, from elegant crepe de chine and miles of fringe to workmen's overalls, jumpsuits, sailor outfits, gold lamé, knotted scarves and long blouses pretending to be dresses. The result is less costume than far‐out individuality.
<br> <br>
Not unexpectedly, most of the crowds—and crowds there are—are young. More surprisingly, most of them are not gilded playgirls and boys, but workers, toiling in offices, design studios, publishing compavies, television studios, artists lofts and chic shops, from 9 to b. After 5, the routine is to climb into bed, sleep four of five hours, have dinner and arrive at New York, New York or Studio 54, both in midtown, or Infinity on the border of SoHo, at midnight or 1 A.M. At sunrise, another hour or two of sleep and. the workday begins.
<br> <br>
The new discos have membership arrangements ($50 at Infinity, $75 at Studio 54 and $100 at New York, New York) that basically entitle one to a lower admission charge than for nonmembers. Admission generally ranges from $4 to $8, depending on the night of the week. At Infinity, which is only open Friday and Saturday nights, drinks range from $1.50 to $2.25, soft drinks are free, and candy, pretzels, popcorn, fruit and dates are free.
<br> <br>
Studio 54 doesn't, as yet, have its liquor license but before it was enjoined from serving, prices were $2.50 a drink. Free food includes such tidbits as licorice sticks, draped around a bust of Nefertiti, brownies, coffee cake and fruit.
<br> <br>
New York, New York has juice and soda for $1.50, drinks from $2.25 to $2.75 and plans for a restaurant floor in September.
<br> <br>
For diversification, the trend‐setters, most of whom had had already made the Manhattan discothèque scene at least once, recently journeyed to Brooklyn on school buses. There they decamped at the Empire Rollerdrome to frolic and dance on skates, for the benefit of the Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc.
<br> <br>
But whether for toiler or trend‐setter—a group that thus far has included Princess Claudia Ruspoli, Egon Von Furstenberg, Nan Kempner, Margaux Hemingway and such normally quiet people as funny Mellon, Noreen Drexel and Givenchy—some of the pleasures of the new discothèques are the apparent classlessness and the comparative classiness.
<br> <br>
And of course, there's the new “in” dancing, which appeals to the ham in everyone. The dancing itself is not much different from what's going on anywhere else, but the idea now is to pause every so often, freeze into an exaggerated pose for 20 to 30 seconds, and then continue on normally—until the urge comes to freeze again.
<br> <br>
Dance, dance, dance until the feet are numb and the room spins, and then on to the mezzanine or balcony, banquettes or edge of the room to weigh the talents and appearance of others. For this time round, action is not the only name of the game. Watching is just as much fun.
