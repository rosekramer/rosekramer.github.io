<h3>Diet Rite Cola Ad - 1975</h3>
I love how bold the type is everywhere in this ad from the headline to the body text. The way the curve of her body is emulated in the curve of both the bottle and the swoosh on the box is also really nice. I also like how the tagline is so subtle at the bottom but still is a smart tagline, reading, <em>On You it Looks Good.</em>
