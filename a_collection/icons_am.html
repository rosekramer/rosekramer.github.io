Ali MacGraw was the poster girl for '70s bohemian glamour. With high-neck blouses, whimsical prints, knee-high boots and Ossie Clark dresses, she mixed bohemian flair with the New England preppy style that she grew up with. It was a romantic, enchanting look representative of her own personality – a free-spirited dreamer, who fell into acting aged 30 and reinvented the modern heroine. “I‘m an incredible romantic – it runs me,” she told Vanity Fair in 2010.

Prior to acting, MacGraw had taken style tips from fashion doyenne Diana Vreeland, for whom she worked as an assistant at Harper's Bazaar. Photographer Melvin Sokolsky soon poached her, impressed by her charm and stylish acumen. “[She] had legs that didn’t stop and a way-ahead intelligence and presence,” he said. MacGraw's acting career didn't take off until 1969, when she landed a part in Goodbye, Columbus, but she went on to star in Love Story, The Getaway and Convoy and was voted the top female box office star in the world in 1972. It was during this time that she embarked on a whirlwind affair with Steve McQueen, who she married in 1973.

However as the style she had pioneered fell out of fashion, Ali quietly slipped away too. She now lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, with her Scottie dog, and is a renowned animal rights advocate.
