In my favorite movie, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16GmbZe_PYQ">Almost Famous</a>, which is set in 1973, the sheltered main character, William receives a box of records from his sister who is leaving home, when leaving she tells him that the records will "set him free." In the scene that follows he flips through all the records staring at the covers as if they were pieces of art in the MET. The physicality of the record has been lost in the age of Spotify and Apple Music. Yes, the visual of an single or album is still extremely important, but many details and specifics of the album cover is lost when the largest you can see the image is the size of an iPhone. A record is like owning a piece of art, both musically and visually. 
<br><br>
This first record I'm focusing on is Blue by Joni Mitchell. This album was released in 1971 and features Joni Mitchell's sweet, melodic and emotional voice relaying her relationships and life. In A Case of You she sings of a lost love singing, "Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine You taste so bitter and so sweet." In my favorite song, California she sings of homesickness, "Oh it gets so lonely When you're walking And the streets are full of strangers All the news of home you read Just gives you the blues." The cover reflects these emotions of confusion, lust, and sadness in just one photo. <h1> A record is like owning a piece of art, both musically and visually</h1>The photo features her face in a melodic position with a duotone blue affect on top. There is inherent emotion in this cover that is expressed in the music within. This photo doesn't need much typography and only features small type towards the top of the album.
<br><br>
I'm including this album cover because I truly love the feature song on this album and in general I think photographic album covers are stronger than graphic ones. Marvin Gaye's What's Going On which was released in 1971 and the cover was shot by James Hendin. The album lyrically is a response to the tragedies going on in the world at that time in 1971 with the Vietnam War among other things. Marvin Gaye's deep connection with this album was because his brother was in the Vietnam War. In What's Happening Brother, he sings about poverty, "Can't find no work, can't find no job my friend Money is tighter than it's ever been." In the smooth Mercy Mercy Me he sings about the environment, "Oil wasted on the oceans and upon our seas, fish full of mercury." The album's cover of Marvin standing in the pouring rain is a beautiful representation of this album. The photo shows him standing in the rain with no shelter, but still standing strong.
<br><br>
XTC: Go 2 (1978) This cover was designed by Hipgosis, a design group who worked with Led Zeppelin and AC/DC among others. The album released in 1978 is a paragraph describing how album covers are the only reason people buy albums anymore. In the paragraph they write,  "A good cover DESIGN is one that attracts morebuyers and gives more pleasure. This writing is trying to pull you in much like an eye-catching picture. It is designed to get you to READ IT. This is called luring the VICTIM, and you are the VICTIM. But if you have a free mind you should STOP READING NOW! because all we are attempting to do is to get you to read on."This cover really reminds me of a lot of the stuff Virgil Abloh is doing for Off White. This self-consciousness of object and consumer is an interesting idea as it confronts the consumer.
