<h1> Blog - 3/7/17</h1>
<p>
I’ve decided to stick with the 70s Fashion & Design theme. I think I am more interested in the west coast movement but I also love the fashion of the disco movement. I find it interesting how I am nostalgic for a time period which I wasn’t alive for. There is definitely a level of glamour in the disco movement which doesn’t exist anymore and there is a level of ease and relaxation in the west coast movement that also doesn’t exist anymore. Both of these “movements” deals with the concept of freedom and being willing to do and be whatever/whomever you want to be. I read this article in the NYT magazine about nostalgia and how designers try to replicate nostalgia in their designs and are often judged for that because they weren’t around then, but in actuality they are really just discovering a new part/time in the world. I want to focus more on movies of the 70s and the title sequences within them. Also, I want to do more advertisement/graphic design focused research. It’s weird that we don’t really know what the “style” of 2017 will be in the future but maybe its a mish-mosh of all times past, aren’t we always just building on the history of the past?</p>
