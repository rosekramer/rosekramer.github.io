<h1>About this blog..</h1>
<div id="maintxt">
This blog is dedicated towards all things 70s fashion and design. I am interested in this topic because I think it's important to look at how objects, people, and events have influenced design in the present-day. The movement of disco during the late 70s/early 80s had a sense of glamour and excess which doesn't really exist anymore. Similarly, the fashion movement of the west coast during the 70s  had a feeling of pure ease and relaxation which also doesn't  exist now. Both of these "movements" deal with the concept of freedom and being willing to do and be whatever/whomever you want to be which is an idea I find really essential. I also love just how much fashion and music are intertwined in a non-commercial way during the 70s. In general, I am obsessed with nostalgia in all parts of my life, <em>but</em>, this website is not trying to recreate or imitate the styles of the 70s but rather create a "one-stop shop" or moodboard of my favorite aspects of 70s fashion and design.
