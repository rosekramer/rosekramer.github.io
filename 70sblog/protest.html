<body><p>At the root of it, graphic design is used to persuade people with a written or visual message. Inherently there is something "political" about every piece of graphic design whether it is subconscious or not. The Vietnam war was very much still in affect halfway into the 1970s and the Kent State shootings caused need for protest. The Kent State shootings were the shootings of students protesting the Vietnam War after they burned the campus ROTC building and threw rocks at the Guardsmen; four students were killed and nine were injured. With this came political posters chanting for freedom and peace for all. Not designed to be art these posters contain messages that are stronger than the visuals. 
<br><br>
This first image is of a silk screened poster called "Flag with Rifles."The poster and title speaks for itself, but I really think this is a strong poster/design as it evokes a feeling without an type. The connection of something so sacred, like the American flag with something so dangerous like the rifle invites a feeling of fear. 
<br><br>
This next protest sign uses copy and image really well together. The sign has imagery of crosses lined up like a graveyard with the message "bring us together" at the bottom. Again, taking the image of the cross, a symbol of peace and purity, but putting it in the context of a graveyard automatically calls for attention and change. The message of bring us together typographically is very beautiful as the type has that quintessential 70s swag to it and the words are almost forming, bringing about the idea of togetherness. But the idea of togetherness with a graveyard is saddening as at the time, war and death was the only thing connecting everyone. 
<br><br>
This final poster I brought up because I like the graphic quality of it. With the two simple words stop war it calls for attention, but by incorporating the already iconic image of the stop sign it creates a universal symbol for peace. 
<br><br>
This topic is still relevant after the constant protests against Donald Trump, and with the way this presidency is going it doesn't seem that this is ending soon. The idea that a single protest poster it is able to capture the feelings of a large group of people in a simple design is truly powerful. </p>
